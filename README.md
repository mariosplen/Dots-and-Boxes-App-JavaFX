Dots and Boxes is a classic game that can be played by two players on a grid of dots. The goal of the game is to surround as many boxes as possible with lines, and the player who surrounds the most boxes wins. This version of the game is implemented in JavaFX and allows the player to customize the game experience by setting the player names, selecting the color and avatar for each player, and choosing the size of the game board.

The first thing the player will see when starting the game is the menu, where they can set the player names, select a color and avatar for each player, and choose the size of the game board.

The player can enter the name of player 1 and player 2 in the corresponding text fields, then they can select a color for each player by clicking on the color picker and choosing a color. They can also select an avatar for each player by clicking on the avatar button and choosing an avatar from the available options. Finally, they can choose the size of the game board by using the drop-down menu.
